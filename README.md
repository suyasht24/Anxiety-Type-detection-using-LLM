# Anxiety Type Detection using LLM

A research-driven project aimed at detecting different types of anxiety from user-submitted text using **Large Language Models (LLM)** like **BERT**. Built with love, care, and Flask ðŸ’™, this AI project supports the mental health domain by offering real-time insights into anxiety patterns.

## Project Overview

Mental health issues, especially anxiety disorders, are on the rise. Our solution uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to classify anxiety types from written input. The model was trained on **synthetically generated and labeled text data** representing various anxiety symptoms.

---

## Features

- Classifies user input into **specific anxiety types**  
- Powered by **BERT fine-tuned** on domain-specific synthetic data  
- Web interface built using **Flask**, **HTML/CSS**, and **JavaScript**  
- Lightweight, fast, and easy to use  
- Focused on **ethical AI and privacy** â€” no data stored

---

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- BERT (HuggingFace Transformers)  
- Flask  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Pandas, scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebooks (for data experiments)

---

## How It Works

1. User submits a sentence describing how they feel  
2. The backend processes the text and sends it to the fine-tuned BERT model  
3. The model predicts the most likely **type of anxiety**  
4. The result is shown on the web interface

## Future Enhancements

- Replace synthetic data with anonymized real-world data  
- Improve accuracy using **RoBERTa / DistilBERT**  
- Add multilingual support  
- Export reports and summaries per user
